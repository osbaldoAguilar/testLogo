# Building a resume with ReactJS.  

For this assignment you are going to build a resume out of components. You're UI should consist of a header component (that may or may not consist of smaller components) for your name, email, and any other details you would want to include, a skills component to let us know about your growing list of skills, as well as a reusable job and portfolio components that can map through data arrays and output your work and portfolio pieces. 

### Rules 
1. Complete wireframe of your resume and send to your mentor, prior to committing code. 
2. Make a really cool resume that is easily updatable by adding to your data objects.
3. Deploy to either netlify or github pages. 

## Stretch goals
1. Implement a database, either airtable or firebase that you can use to update or pull your data. 


## BUILD AND STARTER INSTRUCTIONS
This is a Code the Dream project based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
